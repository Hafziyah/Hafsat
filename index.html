                    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                    <p> My name is Hafsat! I reside in the busy city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos" target="blank"><span>Lagos.</span></a> I have spent about 5-6 years studying Law; LLB from the University of Bradford, LLM from the University of Warwick and a BL from the Nigerian Law school. <strong>So why isn't she practicing Law?</strong> &nbsp;I hear you ask. If every Lawyer knew how much excitement, coding brings into your life, they would be on their computers and not in the court room! <strong>Sssssh, don't tell them though</strong></p>.

                    <p>I also spent 4 years working in a civic organization that sought to utilize technology in encouraging citizen interaction with the various public offices that affected their way of life in the country. This is where my interest in web development was ignited.</p>
                    <p>During a career break I took to care for my 3 adorable babies, <strong>I decided to take the leap and immerse </strong>myself in the exciting world of web development.</p>
                        
                    <p>So please bring some excitement into my life and let me <strong>code your designs into beautiful websites</strong>
                    When not coding, you can find me singing, dancing or talking <strong>in “robot voice” with my kids.</strong></p>
